Like many of us, schools in the United States are [active on social media](https://doi.org/10.1080/17439884.2018.1504791). They use their accounts to [share timely information, build community and highlight staff and students](http://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/qpu8v). However, [our research](https://educationaldatamining.org/EDM2021/virtual/static/pdf/EDM21_paper_276.pdf) has shown that schools' social media activity may harm students' privacy.

My research group came to this topic unintentionally. We were systematically exploring how schools used social media during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in March and April 2020. In the course of this research, we noticed something that surprised us about how Facebook worked: We could view the posts of schools – including images of teachers and students – even when not logged in to our personal Facebook accounts.

The ability to access pages and pictures even when we were not logged in indicated that what schools shared could not only be accessed by anyone, it could also be accessed using [data mining methods](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11528-018-0307-4), new research methods that involve using computers and statistical techniques to discover patterns in large – and often publicly accessible – data sets. 

Since practically all United States schools report their website to the [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/), and many schools link to their Facebook page from their website, these posts could be accessed in a systematic and comprehensive way. In other words, not only researchers, but also businesses, advertisers and even hackers, could access not only individual posts, but, using data mining methods, all of the posts by schools. This is an outcome likely not anticipated by the educators writing these posts.

## Risks are present

The easy access to student photos that we encountered comes despite [broader concerns about individuals' privacy on social media](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/opinion/zuckerberg-privacy-facebook.html). Parents, for instance, have expressed [concerns about teachers posting about their children on social media](https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/12493).

Fortunately, our search of news coverage and academic publications did not reveal any harms that have come to students because their schools posted about them. However, there are a number of possible risks that identifiable posts of students could pose. For one, individual students could be targeted for stalking or bullying online and could be identified by searching the posts. Also, there are newer threats that are larger-scale in scope. For instance, the facial recognition company [Clearview](https://clearview.ai/) collects data from across the Internet and then sells access to the data to law enforcement agencies. Then, law enforcement agencies upload photos of a potential suspect or person of interests to view a list of potential names for the individual depicted in the photo. Clearview already [accesses identifiable photos of minors in the United States from public posts on Facebook](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/business/clearview-facial-recognition-child-sexual-abuse.html). It is possible that photos of students could be accessed and used by Clearview or companies like it.

Even though we are not aware of these things actually happening, that's not reason to not be concerned about it. As technology reporter Kara Swisher wrote, in a time in which our privacy is often threatened, ["only the paranoid survive"](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/24/opinion/location-privacy.html). We think this should especially be the case when it comes to students, minors who may not provide explicit permission to be included within posts.

## Millions of student photos available

In our study, we used [federal data](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/) and a [tool for researchers provided by Facebook](https://www.crowdtangle.com/) to access posts from schools and school districts. We use the term *schools* to refer to both schools and school districts in our study. From this collection of 17.9 million posts by 15,728 schools from 2005 to 2020, we randomly sampled a few hundred and then coded these strictly publicly accessible posts. We determined whether students were named in the post with their first and last name and whether their faces were clearly depicted in a photo. If both of these elements were present, we considered a student to be identified by name and school.

For example, the student in the sample post below – which does not show a real student – would be deemed as identified.

<img width="485" alt="example-fb-img" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4596214/120546913-6aec3680-c3be-11eb-8bb6-ff3acc097fb7.png">
    
After analyzing many posts, we found that there were about 9.3 million posts containing images from 2005-2020 from 15,728 schools. Of those, we estimated that around 467,000 students were identified. In other words, we estimated that there are nearly half a million photos of students on schools' Facebook pages who are identified by first and last name and the location of their school.

## Assessing the risks

While many of us already post photos of ourselves, friends and family – and sometimes our children – on social media, it's different in one important sense. As individuals, we can control who can see our posts. If we want to limit it to just friends and family, we can change our own privacy settings. But people don't necessarily control how schools share their posts and images.

Even if one considers the potential harm of this situation to be minimal, there are small steps that schools may take that could make a notable difference in whether that potential is present at all:

## 1. Refrain from posting students' full names

Not posting students' full names will make it much more difficult for individual students to be targeted and for students' data to be sold and linked with other data sources.

### 2. Make school pages private

Making school pages private means that data mining approaches _ similar to our own – would be much more difficult – if not impossible – to carry out at scale. This single step would drastically minimize risks to students' privacy.

### 3. Use opt-in media release policies

*Opt-in* media release policies that contain extensive information about how schools will post about students can be used instead of opt-out policies. Opt-out policies are less preferable as they place the burden about parents to express that they do not wish for photos of their child to be included in posts on social media. 


The last thing that the teachers and administrators who celebrate their students intend is to cause them harm. We do not think that schools should stop using social media. Instead, we think educators should carefully consider how schools' social media accounts are very different from personal social media accounts. Small steps taken by schools – as well as by parents and even students – can make sure that the next headlines we read about stolen data or frightening privacy violations do not involve some of the most vulnerable members of our society, kids at school.
