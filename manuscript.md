Schools in the United States are [highly active on social media](https://doi.org/10.1080/17439884.2018.1504791). They use their accounts to [share timely information, build community and highlight staff and students](http://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/qpu8v). However, [our research](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/5tpb9) – to be published in the summer of 2021 in Educational Data Mining proceedings **JA: What are proceedings? Is this a journal or not?** –  has shown that schools' social media activity may harm students' privacy

Our research team came to this topic through the back door: We were systematically exploring how districts and schools used social media during the **early days** of the COVID-19 pandemic, in March and April 2020. In the course of this work, we noticed something that surprised us about how Facebook worked: We could view the posts of schools and districts – including images of teachers and students – even when we were not logged in to our personal Facebook accounts.

The ability to access pages and pictures even when we were not logged in told us that what schools and districts shared could not only be accessed by anyone, it could also be accessed using [data mining methods](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11528-018-0307-4). **JA: Can you say here – in a very few words for uninitiated readers like me – what "data mining" is?**

These pictures could easily be accessed by anyone in the world quickly and at scale **JA What does "at scale" mean?**, an outcome likely not imagined by the educators or administrators authoring these posts.

This easy access to student photos comes despite [broader concerns about individuals' privacy on social media](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/opinion/zuckerberg-privacy-facebook.html). Parents, for instance, have expressed [concerns about teachers posting about their children on social media](https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/12493).

For that reason **JA: Which reason?**, we decided to study how schools and districts posted photos of students for which students---who are nearly always minors---can be identified by first and last name and the location of their school or district. **JA: Something is off with this sentence. Please review and fix.**

In our study, we used [federal data](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/) and a [tool for researchers provided by Facebook](https://www.crowdtangle.com/) to access posts from schools and school districts. From this collection of 17.9 million posts by 15,728 institutions from 2005 to 2020, we randomly sampled a few hundred and then coded these strictly publicly accessible posts. In particular, we determined whether students were named in the post with their first and last name and that their faces were clearly depicted in a photo. If both of these elements were present, we considered a student to be identified by name (and school or district). **JA: We don't use parentheses. So is school and district part of this or not?**

For example, the student in the sample post below – which does not show a real student – is identified.

<img width="485" alt="example-fb-img" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4596214/120546913-6aec3680-c3be-11eb-8bb6-ff3acc097fb7.png">
    
After analyzing many posts, we estimated that there were **XXX,XXX** photos shared by schools. Of those, **XXX,XXX** identified students by first and last name. 

On the one hand, this study is intended to illuminate an aspect of social media that is already widely-known: Many of us already post photos of ourselves and our friends and family – and sometimes our children – on social media. However, we can control who can see our posts, and if we want to limit it to just friends and family, we can change our own privacy settings. The accounts of schools and districts are different in important ways from our personal social media accounts – even the social media accounts of individual teachers. 

The posts we analyzed are publicly available online forever unless they are taken down or removed. They are available to anyone in the world, including those intending to disturb or even to harass teachers and students . **JA: Has this happened? I think we discussed how this would be a stronger story if we cite instances or cases in which this has actually happened instead of leaving it out there as a hypothetical or something that could happen in theory**

Students could be targeted for stalking or bullying online and could be identified by searching the posts. The sheer number of students who are identified across districts and schools in the U.S. means that even very rare events could still be taking place much more frequently and easily than we may like.**JA: Again, has this happened?** 

The consistency with which schools and districts link to their publicly accessible Facebook pages through their websites means that the photos we studied are available to others in such a way that the posts of our individual Facebook are not. This poses the risk that companies such as [Clearview](https://clearview.ai/) could automatically access this data. **JA: Why single out Clearview?** Clearview is a facial recognition company that (controversially) collects data from across the Internet at a massive scale and then sells access to the data to law enforcement agencies, who upload photos of suspects of crimes to Clearview. **JA: Is there any evidence that Clearview targets school Facebook pages?** The software returns matches with names for the person of interest. Companies like Clearview, and others who may create or purchase databases of photos that can be linked to other data, may **JA: Again, this "may" stuff is kind of bothersome to me** [readily access identifiable photos of a large number of students---minors---in the United States](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/business/clearview-facial-recognition-child-sexual-abuse.html).

The potential threats we raised above could appear far-fetched, and we recognize that the harm to students to this point has not, thankfully, manifested. But, these photos on schools’ and districts’ pages may represent the largest unstructured but accessible collection of identifiable images of minors in the United States, and, if accessed, could pose serious harms in the future. **JA: I think you need to acknowledge this really high up in the story.**

Even if one considers the potential harm to be minimal, there are small steps that schools and districts may take that may make a notable difference in whether that potential is present at all:

## 1. Refrain from posting students' full names

Not posting students' full names will make it much more difficult for individual students to be targeted and for students' data to be sold and linked with other data sources.

## 2. Make school pages private

Making school pages private means that data mining approaches (similar to our own) would be much more difficult---if not impossible---to carry out at scale. This single step would drastically minimize risks to students' privacy.

## 3. Use opt-in media release policies

Opt-in media release policies that contain extensive information about bow schools and districts will post about students can be used instead of opt-out policies. Opt-out policies are less preferable as they place the burden about parents to express that they do not wish for photos of their child to be included in posts on social media. To our knowledge, neither scholars nor journalists have studied or reported on the use of media release policies for students in schools. 

## Conclusion

Because of the potential for harm, we argue that while we individually and collectively work out what safeguards we will take to protect our privacy, we should, like technology reporter Kara Swisher argues, [all be](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/24/opinion/location-privacy.html)---be just a little paranoid about privacy]. We think this should especially be the case when it comes to students, who may not provide explicit permission to be included within posts.

We recognize that the last thing that the teachers and administrators who celebrate their students intend is to cause them harm We do not think that districts and schools should stop using social media. Instead, we think that the representatives of schools and districts should carefully consider how school and school district social media accounts are very different from personal social media account. Small steps taken by schools and districts as well as by parents and even students can make sure that the next headlines we read about stolen data or frightening privacy violations do not involve some of the most vulnerable members of our society, kids at school.
